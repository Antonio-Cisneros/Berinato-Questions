# Good Charts - The HBR Guide to Making Smarter, More Persuasive Data Visualizations

## Two questions --> Four types

### A simple typology for chart making

#### What are the goals of data-driven?
Inform and enlighten all statistical approach of the data.

#### When the types are conceptual and declarative, what is the illustration made?
An illustration of ideas that will summarize the concept of data only to show the performance cost.

#### Idea illustrations demand clear and simple design, why they often lack it?
The visual issues are the breakdown of communication in the size of the graphic, and distraction from the message.

#### Why visual exploration aims for insights in the data?
Since it will gather all statistics properties to stablish a monumental inclusive premise in data comparison and visualization.

## Better charts in a couple of hours

### A simple framework

#### Which are the three kind of spaces?
Mental space, physical space, and white space.

#### Why is it need more inputs before jumping right to chart types and design?
It helps to define the context and identify the visual approach that will be most effective.

#### Which is the bridge between idea and visualization?
Sketching

#### Which are the type of graphs usually use to identify trends?
Line graphs

#### Which are the three categories of prototyping?
Paper, digital, and paired.

#### Which prototype category is good for simpler datasets and simpler visualizations?
Paper prototyping.

## Refine to impress

### Getting to the "Feeling behind our eyes"

#### What are the elements which a graph shoud include and their divition proportion?
Title (12%), subtitle (8%), visual field (75%), and source line (5%).

#### What is the importance of data-ink ratio in chart simplicity?
It signifies a better design and efficient proportions to data presentations

#### Why a question flow is used?
To identify the elements which should or shouldn't be kept to make the simpler graph visualization

#### What is belt-and-suspenders-design?
The decision of distinguish the use of subtitles elements, size and italics and decide which is the best one to put onto your chart.

## Refine to persuade

### Three steps to more-persuasive charts

#### According to the chapter 6, What is salient information?0.0 to 50
The perception of information that will most likely to capture public's attention based on the cognition of estimulation.

#### What is the most obvious and common form of emphasis on a chart?
A rich color.

#### How an idea is being isolated?
By removing or eliminating elements from the charts, desemphasizing other visual aspects, and non-identify the information goal.

#### Which are the three manipulation for reference points?
Remove, add, and shift.

## Persuasion or manipulation?

### The blurred edge of truth

#### Which are the four types of deception?
Falsification, exaggeration, omission, and equivocation.

#### What the truncated y-axis is might be effective?
It will emphasize the idea, and manipulate the retinant variables of the chart to make it more dramatic.

#### What is the truncation issue for the human mind?
Make a difference between the bottom and end of a chart where the constant of the cue it might be zero. The human mind will expend more mental energy on trying to understand the meaning.

#### What is the use for chloropleths?
Identify regional trends on maps.
